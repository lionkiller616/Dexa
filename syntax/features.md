# 🚀 Dexa Language — Features

Dexa is a next-generation unified language for documents, data, diagrams, math, and configurations. It replaces multiple formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML, Mermaid, LaTeX, TOML, SQLite, etc.) with a **single elegant, human-friendly format** that is extensible, secure, and efficient.

## 🧩 Unified Format for Everything

| Purpose             | Dexa Replacement             | Bonus Dexa Features                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Markdown            | `prose:` blocks              | Clean inline styles + merged with data        |
| Mermaid Diagrams    | `dxd:` blocks                | Symbolic syntax + diagram types in one style  |
| JSON / YAML / TOML  | `type`, `data`, `const`      | Human-readable + schema-aware                |
| LaTeX / MathML      | `math:` and `∫:` blocks      | Block + inline math, no cryptic syntax        |
| Config Files        | `.dxc` config blocks         | Safe nesting, type checks, readable           |
| Database Files      | `.dx` data blocks            | Tabular, indexable, queryable, relational     |
| Binary Formats      | `.dex` compiled output       | Compressed, encrypted, portable               |

## 🧠 Core Features

### ✅ Language-Level

- ✅ Typed constants, structs, and type aliases
- ✅ Prose markdown blocks (`prose:`) with headings, links, lists
- ✅ Human-readable data (`data:`) linked to types
- ✅ Native diagram system (`dxd:`) – flowcharts, mindmaps, timelines, and more
- ✅ Elegant math syntax (`math:`, `∫:`) for block and inline expressions
- ✅ Rich config syntax (`config:`) safer than YAML/TOML/INI
- ✅ Typed `.dx` database files with schemas and rows
- ✅ `.dex` compiled binary format for performance

### 📊 Diagram Types (`dxd:`)

- Graph (flow, logic)
- Class diagrams
- Mindmaps
- Timelines
- States / FSM
- Org charts
- Grid layouts
- Tree diagrams
- Custom styles (colors, icons, borders)

### 🧮 Math Features (`math:`)

- Sums, integrals, limits, derivatives
- Equations, fractions, exponents
- Matrices, vectors
- Inline math with `∫:` anywhere in prose
- Consistent, readable math syntax

### 🗃️ Database Features (`.dx`)

- Table and row definitions
- Type-safe field declarations
- Nested data and arrays
- Indexing and filtering (planned)
- SQLite/NoSQL-style use cases

---

## 🔐 Safety & Security

- Type-safe by design (no more guessing)
- Clear syntax boundaries (no YAML indentation problems)
- Self-documenting format (code is the doc)
- Optional `.dex` encryption for binaries
- Safe fallbacks and validation layers

---

## 🛠️ Developer Benefits

- 💡 One language, no format switching
- 🧩 Unified and extensible syntax
- 🔎 Easy to debug, version, lint
- 📦 Easy parsing from Python, Rust, Go, JS
- 🔁 Bidirectional export to JSON, SQL, HTML, Markdown
- 🔧 CLI + runtime engine planned (Python-based)

---

## 🌐 Ideal For

- Docs + Data fusion
- Config + Code definition
- AI-ready knowledge files
- Clean knowledgebases
- Data science notebooks
- Game dev config/data pipelines
- Developer documentation

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- 🔌 Plugin system for new block types
- 📊 Visual editor for `.daxa` and `.dxd`
- 🗂️ Git-aware `.dex` storage for fast versioning
- 🔄 Real-time Dexa-to-HTML/JSON/SQL converters
- 🧰 Cross-language parsers (Python, Rust, JS)

---

## 🎯 Why Dexa?

Dexa is more than a format—it's a **language** designed for the next era of data + documentation. Built for humans, structured for machines, and extensible for everything in between.
